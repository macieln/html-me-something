                <p>My first experience with programming was at the age of 16 in 
                    high school. For a younger me it was a new challenge and far 
                    more appealing than the other required subjects.
                </p>
                <p>Since then not a whole lot of programming has happpend in my 
                    professional life. In fact, it might seem like anything but
                    programming would become my career of choice, until the last
                    two years.
                </p>
                <p>After graduating from high school I worked for a plumbing 
                    company, then doing maintance on equipment for a different 
                    company. After, that I got into manufacturing and the 
                    same company hire me has a helpdesk technician.
                </p>
                <p>On New Year's Eve 2015, while smoking a cigar, I decided to 
                    learn how program, in the hopes that some day I would be 
                    making a living out of it.  
                </p>
                <p>Since then, I got a new job as a technician at intel.
                    However, my desire to learn programming and computer
                    science in general continue to grow.
